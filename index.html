        <h1>Exhibition Theme</h1>
        <p class="lead">The exhibition is about the introduction of a Chinese female writer and architectural historian called Lin Huiyin. It aims to show the real life of the legendary woman. Most of her photography, manuscripts of her works are placed in IV3DE which re-examine her fascinating life and ground-breaking work.
            <br>In total, there are selected 40 frameworks and two 3D design models of Lin. Among frameworks, 28 photos showing Lin’s lifetime based on time line and 12 works. Most of them are manuscripts including 6 letters, 1 poem, 3 architectural designs, 2 drawings. 
            Photo
            The content of original photos is divided into three parts which are family, personal life and working time. In the first display room, first of all, two photos of Lin’s parents. Then comes by her infant period, childhood, study, marriage, honey moon, entertainment with friends and funerary. In the second showing room, the photos are about her working time on ancient building protection.
            Letter
            Letter part contains 2 prints and 4 manuscripts. The receivers are Sheng Congwen, Jin Yuelin, Lin’s daughter and Fu Sinian. 
            Shen Congwen is considered to be one of the greatest modern Chinese writers, on par with Lu Xun. Regional culture and identity played a much bigger role in his writing than that of other major early modern Chinese writers. He was known for combining the vernacular style with classical Chinese writing techniques. Shen is the most important of the "native soil" writers in modern Chinese literature. He was slated to win the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, but died before he could be awarded the prize.
            Shen and Lin are good friends of life. Even during the war, they also maintained communication, mutual support and encouragement, and sought spiritual comfort. In 1949, Shen almost collapsed because of a serious mental attack. Lin brought him to her home and took good care of him.
            When Lin was delegated to design the national emblem, which was a great proud, at meanwhile, Shen was frustrated of his work. Lin could not give Shen more words to comfort him but silently gave Shen some help on economy. 
            Jin Yuelin, was a Chinese philosopher best known for three works, one each on logic, metaphysics, and epistemology. He was also a commentator on Bertrand Russell.
            When mentioning Jin Yuelin, the first impression people had was not the philosophical master, but an infatuated man. His love for Lin has been relished by future generations. Jin, Liang, and Lin are good friends. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they all taught at Tsinghua University and had a happy time in your busy work. But the ending of the story was not the same. Liang and Lin were couple, Jin admired Lin and never married for a lifetime because of Lin.
            Fu Sinian, was a famous Chinese educator and linguist, and one of the leaders of the May Fourth Movement in 1919. He studied experimental psychology at University College London from 1920-23. He was also one of the creators of the Academia Sinica, and was named director of the Institute of History and Philology upon its founding in 1928.
            Lin’s letter to Fu Sinian allows people to read the patriotic love of the intellectuals at that time and the sense of belonging in a chaotic world. Understanding the relationship among Fu Sinian, Lin and Liang, has to make people lament the poetic interpersonal relationship of the intellectuals of the Republic of China.
            Liang and Lin have a son and a daughter in their lifetime. Liang Zaibing is daughter and Liang Congjie is her younger brother. Liang Zaibing was born in August 1929. The origin of Liang Zaibing’s name comes from the commemoration of Grandfather Liang Qichao. In order to commemorate Liang Qichao, the father who died half a year ago, Liang and Lin were named after the newly born daughter, and they had the will to inherit. At the same time, Lin was very fond of her daughter, and she also gave her daughter a name of “baby” to show her love.
            All the photography and manuscripts of the exhibition are all from the book Liang Sicheng Lin Huiyin Image and Manuscript Collection which is edited by Hu Muqing and Huang Shuzhi. It is the first compilation of Liang and Lin's images and manuscripts to commemorate the 110th anniversary of Lin's birth. For various reasons, Lin and Liang have not collected works so far. The publication of this book provides valuable first-hand information for the research institutions, experts and scholars, libraries, archives and Lin’s followers. There are 369 precious images of Liang and Lin, and 21 manuscripts of them.
            This book is the only public publication that has been jointly authorized by Liang and Lin's family members. It is the first time to integrate many precious images and manuscript documents of the Liang, Lin families and the Shanghai Art and Gift Museum, the key units of the domestic Liang and Lin document collections, and the Tsinghua University Archives. It is by far the most complete collection of Liang and Lin images, and many precious manuscripts have also made their debut.
            The manuscripts, whether it is Liang, Lin's ancient architectural investigation report, literary works, major projects (such as the Monument to the People's Heroes), are of great academic value for the study of Liang and Lin. The image version of the book is provided by the Liang and Lin family members for the original printing.
